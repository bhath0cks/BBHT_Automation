# BBHT_Automation for Recon
Bug Bounty Hunting Tools Automation for Recon by Ahmad Raihan Prawira

****UPDATE**** : 
1. This tool is specifically designed for ****MEDIUM SCOPE**** Only !!!
2. ****Specific_Recon.sh**** only used if you already have the list of the domain through chaos.projectdiscovery.io

Tools I'm Using :
- Subfinder combined with Multiple API Keys (Subdomain Enumeration)
- Puredns (Subdomain Bruteforcing / DNS Resolver)
- Ripgen (Subdomain Permutations)
- Httpx (Checking wheter alive or dead subdomains)
- Gau, Katana, Gospider, Hakrawler (Crawling Subdomains)
- SecretFinder (Finding Secrets in the JSFiles)
- Ffuf (Fuzzing)
- Dnsx (Finding Origin IP through subdomains via DNS Enumeration / DNS Resolver)
- Gfx and Gf Pattern (Finding Specific Vulnerabilities)

For little bit explanation about recon methodology or scripts or Getting API Keys in Subdomain Enumeration you can refer the link below :

Although this automation script is not perfect, i am open to receive any suggestions.
