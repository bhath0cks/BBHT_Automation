# BBHT_Automation for Recon
Bug Bounty Hunting Tools Automation for Recon by Ahmad Raihan Prawira

****UPDATE : Specific_Recon.sh only used if you already have the list of subdomains through chaos.projectdiscovery.io/#/.****

Tools I'm Using :
- Subfinder (Subdomain Enumeration)
- Goaltdns (Subdomain Permutations)
- Puredns (DNS Resolver)
- Httpx (Checking wheter alive or dead subdomains)
- Gau, Katana, Gospider, Hakrawler (Crawling Subdomains)
- SecretFinder (Finding Secrets in the JSFiles)
- Ffuf (Fuzzing)
- Dnsx (Finding Origin IP through subdomains via DNS Enumeration / DNS Resolver)
- Gfx and Gf Pattern (Finding Specific Vulnerabilities)

Although this automation script is not perfect, i am open to receive any suggestions.
