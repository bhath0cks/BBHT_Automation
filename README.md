# BBHT_Automation for Recon
Bug Bounty Hunting Tools Automation for Recon by Ahmad Raihan Prawira

****UPDATE**** : 
1. This automation script is specifically designed for ****MEDIUM SCOPE**** Only !!!
2. ****Specific_Recon.sh**** only used if you already have the list of the domain through chaos.projectdiscovery.io
3. Make sure to create ~/Documents/Notes/Subdomain and ~/Documents/Notes/wordlists directory first before using this automation scripts

**Recommended to use BBH_Script.sh for maximum Recon**

Tools I'm Using :
- Subfinder combined with Multiple API Keys (Subdomain Enumeration)
- Puredns (Subdomain Bruteforcing / DNS Resolver)
- Ripgen (Subdomain Permutations)
- Httpx (Checking wheter alive or dead subdomains)
- Gau, Katana, Gospider, Hakrawler (Crawling Subdomains)
- SecretFinder (Finding Secrets in the JSFiles)
- Ffuf (Fuzzing)
- Dnsx (Finding Origin IP through subdomains)
- Gfx and Gf Pattern (Finding Specific Vulnerabilities)

Although this automation script is not perfect, i am open to receive any suggestions.
