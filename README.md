# BBHT_Automation
Bug Bounty Hunting Tools Automation by Ahmad Raihan Prawira

Pros and Cons of my BBHT_Script : 
1. Full_Reconaissance\
[+] Better Output/Results\
[-] It takes much time

2. Simple_Reconnaisance\
[+] Short Amount of time\
[-] Output / Results not as good as Full_Reconnaisance

Tools i used in BB for Hunting :
- Subfinder
- Amass
- Assetfinder
- Subscraper
- Github-Subdomains
- Gf-Pattern
- Httprobe
- Httpx
- Gau
- Arjun
- Dirsearch

More tools will be added. Coming Soon.

For BBHT_install i'm took reference from :
https://github.com/unethicalnoob/BBHTv2

Because in the link above it have an issue while installing the tools due to go get command is no longer supported by golang latest version
